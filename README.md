## The Project

This portfolio is a **dynamic and responsive web application** built using **Angular**, showcasing my skills and projects as a software developer.

## Development server

You can run this project locally too.

Clone this repo.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Test

Run `ng test` to test the project. This will launch the Karma test runner and execute all Jasmine test specs (`*.spec.ts` files).
